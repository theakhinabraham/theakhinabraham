**`Data Scientist: Building ML Models that Matter.`**

I'm not just coding, I'm building my piece of the digital world, pixel by pixel. Each project? An adventure! I analyse, design, and then build models that solve real problems.

Unleash the hidden revenue in your data. I build custom machine learning models that streamline workflows and boost your bottom line.

   <h2>üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Never Too Late to Code: My Coding Journey</h2>

I love helping businesses work efficiently and save time. That's what got me to be a Data Scientist.

During 8th-grade computer classes, we moved from theory classes to actual coding. Then it struck me that I can turn my creativity into something beautiful with code. That's how I fell in love.

We were told to focus on physics and history so I considered coding as a fun hobby that I enjoy doing.

I opted for science for 11th grade. I was great at biology and math, but I knew something was off. I didn't enjoy it.

When it was time to pick a college, it hit me that THIS was going to shape my future. I decided to be a Software Developer.

During college, I led multiple teams for group projects. We made web apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL & Bootstrap. We learned app development with Android Studio using Java and Firebase. Additionally, we learned C, C++, Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms.

My 1-month Internship program with Techgentsia as an App Developer exposed me to work life and office environment. I grasped team management and team leadership. Above all, I realised that you can't hate the work that you enjoy.

My learning curve never ends. I began to learn Python, Mathematics, Data Modelling, Machine Learning and SQL for Data Science.

I decided to take my Masters in Data Science from the UK to gain additional knowledge and pick Data Science as my Career Path.

I create Machine Learning Products and Applications in my free time, stay updated with the new technologies and continue to learn.

Time management and quality are key when it comes to development. I realised that the way to achieve efficiency is by doing what you love and enjoy doing.

Fortunately, I love coding.

<h2>ðŸŽ¢ Akhin's Coding Journey</h2>

When I was in 8th grade, I had Computer classes but everyone considered it a boring subject. Even our teachers valued Science, Social Science and Maths more. I was good at Science and Maths too, but I also had a huge attachment with Computer Science. I did not consider Computer Science as a subject that I must learn to score marks, but I actually enjoyed it. Something told me that it was meant for me. But, I pursued Bio-maths for my Higher Secondary Education. I enjoyed Biology and Maths, but I just missed creating and developing code instead of just understanding concepts of Science. When it was time to pick my Bachelors, I decided to follow my passion of coding. Putting in the use of Mathematics, I could easily grasp Data Structure and Algorithms. With my ability to learn quickly through imagination rather than reading words as it is, I started to exponentially grow my knowledge of learning new languages after a long 4 year break.

Throughout my Bachelors of Computer Application, I learnt: C, C++, JavaScript, Mathematics, Algorithms, Data Structures, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, Android Studio with Java. Our College managed to get us paid access to all courses. We were told to do 2, but I realised that I had access to 6-7 certification courses, so i made complete use of it. With this opportunity, I managed to learn: Python, Mathematical Problem Solving, JavaScript, Data Structure, and a few more.

My eagerness and excitement to learn never fades over time. So, I decided to learn even more from YouTube and Books. Even though I didn't get certificates, I learnt many new things. I realised that NoSQL is more comfortable for me than MySQL. I realised that Java is outdated for Android Studio. My options were Kotlin for Android or Flutter for Cross Platform. I decided to pick Flutter. I will learn Kotlin as well when I find time. I learned Firebase & Firestore. I learned to host websites, wordpress elementor, domain and hosting process, SEO, and many more.

During our 1 month internship at Techgentsia, My performance as an Android Developer was extreme. I learned team management, how exciting and fun your work at office can be, leadership, and problem solving.

The story doesn't end here. It never does.

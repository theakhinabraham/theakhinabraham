   <h2>üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Never Too Late to Code: My Coding Journey</h2>

I love helping people live an easier and more joyful life. That's what got me to be a Flutter Developer.

During 8th-grade computer classes, we moved from theory classes to actual coding. Then it struck me that I can turn my creativity into something beautiful with code. That's how I fell in love.

We were told to focus on physics and history so I considered coding as a fun hobby that I enjoy doing.

I opted for science for 11th grade. I was great at biology and math, but I knew something was off. I didn't enjoy it.

When it was time to pick a college, it hit me that THIS was going to shape my future. I decided to be a Software Developer.

During college, I led multiple teams for group projects. We made web apps with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL & Bootstrap. We learned app development with Android Studio using Java and Firebase. Additionally, we learned C, C++, Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms.

My 1-month Internship program with Techgentsia as an App Developer exposed me to work life and office environment. I grasped team management and team leadership. Above all, I realised that you can't hate the work that you enjoy.

My learning curve never ends. I began to learn online and understood additional concepts of Flutter & Dart and decided to be a Flutter Developer. I extended my knowledge with Riverpod, RESTful API & graphQL API.

I decided to learn Kotlin for Android Development with Jetpack Compose, JUnit5 and more. Now, I can build both cross platform apps and native apps with beautiful UI designs.

I create mobile applications in my free time, stay updated with the new technologies and continue to learn.

Time management and quality are key when it comes to development. I realised that the way to achieve efficiency is by doing what you love and enjoy doing.

Fortunately, I love coding.
